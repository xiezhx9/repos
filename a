java.net.UnknownHostException: Trying to listen on loopback address, 127.0.1.1:3181 but this is forbidden by default (see ServerConfiguration#getAllowLoopback()).
If this happen, you can consider specifying the network interface to listen on (e.g. listeningInterface=eth0) or specifying the advertised address (e.g. advertisedAddress=172.x.y.z)
